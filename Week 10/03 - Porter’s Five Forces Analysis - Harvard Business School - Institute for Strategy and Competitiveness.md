# 📘 Porter's Five Forces – Harvard Business School Summary

## 🔍 Overview

Porter's Five Forces framework, introduced by Michael E. Porter in 1979, is a tool for analyzing the competitive forces within an industry. It helps businesses understand the dynamics affecting profitability and guides strategic decision-making.

## 🧱 The Five Forces

### 1. 🧱 Threat of New Entrants

- **Description**: New entrants can increase competition, potentially reducing profitability for existing firms.
- **Factors Influencing Threat**:
  - **Barriers to Entry**: High barriers (e.g., economies of scale, brand loyalty, access to distribution channels, government regulations) reduce the threat.
  - **Incumbent Response**: The likelihood of retaliation from existing firms can deter new entrants.
  - **Capital Requirements**: Significant investment needs can be a deterrent.

### 2. 🔗 Bargaining Power of Suppliers

- **Description**: Suppliers can exert influence by raising prices or reducing the quality of goods/services.
- **Factors Influencing Power**:
  - **Number of Suppliers**: Fewer suppliers increase their power.
  - **Uniqueness of Service**: Specialized inputs grant more power to suppliers.
  - **Switching Costs**: High costs for switching suppliers enhance their leverage.

### 3. 🛒 Bargaining Power of Buyers

- **Description**: Buyers can demand lower prices or higher product quality, impacting profitability.
- **Factors Influencing Power**:
  - **Buyer Concentration**: Few buyers purchasing large volumes increase their power.
  - **Product Differentiation**: Less differentiation increases buyer power.
  - **Price Sensitivity**: High sensitivity enhances buyer leverage.
  - **Switching Costs**: Low costs make it easier for buyers to switch, increasing their power.

### 4. 🔄 Threat of Substitute Products or Services

- **Description**: Alternative products can fulfill the same need, limiting industry profitability.
- **Factors Influencing Threat**:
  - **Availability of Substitutes**: More alternatives increase the threat.
  - **Price-Performance Trade-off**: Better value substitutes pose a higher threat.
  - **Switching Costs**: Lower costs make substitution easier.

### 5. ⚔️ Rivalry Among Existing Competitors

- **Description**: Intense competition can drive down prices and profitability.
- **Factors Influencing Rivalry**:
  - **Number of Competitors**: More competitors typically increase rivalry.
  - **Industry Growth**: Slow growth intensifies competition.
  - **Product Differentiation**: Less differentiation leads to more price-based competition.
  - **Exit Barriers**: High barriers keep firms in the industry, intensifying rivalry.

## 🧭 Strategic Implications

- **Industry Attractiveness**: Understanding these forces helps assess the potential profitability of an industry.
- **Strategic Positioning**: Firms can develop strategies to influence these forces in their favor.
- **Dynamic Nature**: Industry structures evolve; regular analysis is essential for sustained competitiveness.
