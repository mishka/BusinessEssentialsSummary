## 🧠 Porter’s Five Forces – Analysing Industry Structure

Developed by **Michael Porter** (Harvard, 1979), this model helps evaluate the competitiveness of a market and shape strategic decisions.

### 1. 🧱 Threat of New Entrants
- High if:
  - Low cost/time required to enter the market
  - Few economies of scale
  - Weak brand loyalty in the industry
  - Easy access to suppliers and distributors
  - Low tech/IP barriers
- New entrants can erode your market share if you’re unprotected.

### 2. 🔗 Bargaining Power of Suppliers
- Increases when:
  - Few suppliers for essential inputs
  - High switching costs between suppliers
  - Suppliers offer unique or rare components
  - Suppliers can forward integrate (e.g. start selling to customers directly)
- Can raise input prices or reduce service levels

### 3. 🛒 Bargaining Power of Buyers (Customers)
- Strong when:
  - Few buyers or buyers make large-volume purchases
  - Many alternative suppliers/substitutes exist
  - Products are standardised or undifferentiated
  - Switching costs for buyers are low
- May demand lower prices or better service

### Switching Costs Include:
- Exit fees (contract cancellation)
- Setup/installation costs with new supplier
- New equipment costs

### 4. 🔄 Threat of Substitutes
- High when:
  - Customers can easily find different ways to meet the same need
  - Alternatives offer better value, convenience, or performance
- Example: cars vs bikes, emails vs letters
- Substitutes limit pricing power and reduce customer loyalty

### 5. ⚖️ Competitive Rivalry
- Intense when:
  - Many similar-sized competitors
  - Products are similar, with little differentiation
  - Low switching costs for customers
  - Market growth is slow or stagnant
- Reduces profitability across the industry
- Strong **USP** and brand identity reduce the threat

Businesses can choose one of the following approaches to gain and sustain a competitive advantage:

### 1. 💸 Cost Leadership
- Aim: Be the lowest-cost producer
- Benefits: Attract price-sensitive customers
- Risk: Can lead to a price war and low margins
- Example: **Aldi**, **Iceland**

### 2. 🌟 Differentiation (Premium)
- Aim: Offer unique, high-quality products or services
- Customers willing to pay more for perceived value
- Requires strong branding, innovation, customer service
- Example: **Waitrose**, **Apple**

### 3. 🎯 Focus / Niche Strategy
- Aim: Serve a specific market segment better than competitors
- Can be cost-based or differentiation-based
- Builds loyalty by tailoring products/services
- Example: **Marks & Spencer’s food**, **Luxury boutiques**

### 🧠 Supermarket Task
- Match UK supermarkets to Porter’s strategies:
  - **Tesco** – Cost leadership with some differentiation
  - **Sainsbury’s** – Mid-market with lean towards differentiation
  - **Waitrose** – Premium differentiation
  - **M&S** – Niche/differentiation in food
  - **Iceland** – Cost leadership with a focus on frozen food
