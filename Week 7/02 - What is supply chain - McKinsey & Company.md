# 📘 McKinsey Explainer: What Is a Supply Chain?

## 🔍 Definition

A **supply chain** encompasses the entire journey of raw materials, components, and goods from their origin to the end consumer. It involves interconnected processes and stakeholders that transform raw inputs into finished products and deliver them to customers.

## 🧱 Key Stakeholders in the Supply Chain

- **Producers**: Extract or grow raw materials (e.g., mining iron ore).
- **Vendors**: Purchase and resell materials.
- **Manufacturers**: Convert materials into finished goods.
- **Transporters (Logistics Providers)**: Move goods globally.
- **Supply Chain Managers**: Oversee operations from planning to delivery.
- **Retailers**: Sell products to consumers, both online and in-store.
- **Consumers**: Purchase and use the final products.

## 🔄 Supply Chain vs. Value Chain

- **Supply Chain**: Focuses on the production and distribution of goods.
- **Value Chain**: Encompasses all activities adding value to a product, including design, marketing, and sales.

## ⚠️ Supply Chain Disruptions

Disruptions occur when any part of the supply chain fails to function optimally. Common vulnerabilities include:

- **Planning and Supplier Networks**: Inefficient planning or unreliable suppliers.
- **Transportation and Logistics Systems**: Delays or failures in moving goods.
- **Financial Resiliency**: Inability to absorb financial shocks.
- **Product Complexity**: Complicated products requiring intricate supply chains.
- **Organizational Maturity**: Lack of preparedness or adaptability.

On average, significant supply chain disruptions lasting a month or more occur every 3.7 years, potentially costing organizations up to 45% of a year's profits over a decade.

## 🛡️ Types of Supply Chain Risks

McKinsey categorizes supply chain shocks into four types:

1. **Unanticipated Catastrophes**: Rare, massive events (e.g., systemic cyberattacks).
2. **Foreseeable Catastrophes**: Large-scale events with some predictability (e.g., financial crises).
3. **Unanticipated Disruptions**: Smaller, unexpected events (e.g., industrial accidents).
4. **Foreseeable Disruptions**: Predictable issues (e.g., trade disputes).
