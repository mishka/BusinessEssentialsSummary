# Oral Presentations: Key Strategies

## 1. Plan Your Presentation
- **Understand Your Purpose and Audience:**
  - Clarify the goal of your presentation and consider the audience's knowledge level and interests.
- **Create a Planning Schedule:**
  - Break down tasks such as interpreting the brief, researching, outlining, and rehearsing.
- **Define Your Key Message:**
  - Identify the central point you want to convey and ensure all content supports it.
- **Structure Your Content:**
  - **Introduction:** Present your key message and outline the presentation.
  - **Main Body:** Discuss relevant points in a logical order.
  - **Conclusion:** Summarise the purpose and key message, and possibly set the discussion in a wider context.
- **Check the Venue:**
  - Familiarise yourself with the room's layout and available equipment.

## 2. Design Your Presentation
- **Use Appropriate Software:**
  - Choose tools like PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides, or Prezi based on your comfort and the presentation's needs.
- **Ensure Readability:**
  - Use a minimum font size of 24 for body text and larger for headings.
  - Limit text on slides to keep the audience focused on your speech.
- **Present Data Effectively:**
  - Select suitable formats (e.g., graphs, tables) and display only pertinent data.

## 3. Practise Your Presentation
- **Rehearse Thoroughly:**
  - Practice alone and with a test audience to refine delivery and timing.
- **Manage Nerves:**
  - Recognise that some anxiety is normal; channel it to stay alert.
- **Use Cue Cards:**
  - Prepare keyword prompts to aid natural delivery without reading from a script.

## 4. Delivering Your Presentation
- **Engage with the Audience:**
  - Maintain eye contact and use open body language.
- **Control Your Pace:**
  - Speak clearly and at a measured speed to ensure understanding.
- **Handle Questions Confidently:**
  - Anticipate potential questions and prepare responses.
