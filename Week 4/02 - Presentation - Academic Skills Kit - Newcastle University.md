# Academic Presentations: Key Tips

## 1. Practise in Different Situations
- **Gradual Exposure:** Start by rehearsing alone, then with friends, and eventually in settings that mimic the actual presentation environment.
- **Manage Nerves:** Recognise that some nervousness is natural and can enhance alertness during delivery.

## 2. Limit the Scope of Your Argument
- **Be Realistic:** Focus on essential points that fit within your allotted time.
- **Clarity:** Define key messages and ensure all content supports them.

## 3. Keep an Eye on the Time
- **Time Management:** Conduct timed rehearsals to avoid overrunning.
- **Adaptability:** If time becomes tight, skip less critical points but always provide a conclusion.

## 4. Prepare for the Q&A
- **Anticipate Questions:** Identify complex or briefly mentioned topics and prepare clarifications or expansions.

## 5. Decide Whether to Show or Tell Information
- **Slide Design:** Use slides to highlight main ideas with clear fonts and high-contrast colours; avoid overcrowding with text.
- **Visual Aids:** Remember, slides support your presentationâ€”they aren't the main focus.

## 6. Cater to Your Audience
- **Understand Expectations:** Align your presentation with the assignment brief and marking criteria.
- **Demonstrate Skills:** Showcase both your knowledge and presentation abilities as required.

## 7. Keep the Language Simple
- **Accessibility:** Use straightforward language and repeat key messages to aid understanding.
- **Formality:** Adopt a conversational tone appropriate for spoken delivery.

## 8. Slow Your Speech Down
- **Pacing:** Aim to speak about 33% slower than your normal rate to enhance clarity.
- **Practice:** Rehearse at this pace to become comfortable with the delivery.

## 9. Make Eye Contact
- **Engagement:** Maintain eye contact to keep the audience connected.
- **Reminders:** Include prompts in your notes to look at the audience periodically.

## 10. Experiment with Different Kinds of Presentation Notes
- **Find What Works:** Choose between a full script, bullet points, or memorisation based on your comfort level.
- **Flexibility:** Test various methods to determine the most effective approach for you.
