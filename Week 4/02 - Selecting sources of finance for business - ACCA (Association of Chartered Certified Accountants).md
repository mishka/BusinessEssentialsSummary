# Selecting Sources of Finance for Business

## Key Considerations

1. **Internal vs External Financing**
   - **Internal**: Assess available cash reserves and projected cash flows to determine if internal funds can support new projects.
   - **External**: If internal funds are insufficient, explore external financing options.

2. **Debt vs Equity Financing**
   - **Debt**: Typically cheaper due to tax-deductible interest payments and priority claims in liquidation.
   - **Equity**: More expensive as investors demand higher returns due to increased risk.

3. **Factors Influencing Financing Decisions**
   - **Cost**: Debt is generally less costly than equity.
   - **Control**: Issuing new equity may dilute existing ownership, whereas debt does not affect control.
   - **Risk**: High levels of debt increase financial risk due to obligatory interest payments.
   - **Flexibility**: Equity provides more flexibility as there are no mandatory repayments.

## Practical Steps

- **Evaluate Internal Resources**: Review current cash balances and future cash flow projections.
- **Consider Working Capital Management**: Improve cash position by managing receivables, payables, and inventory efficiently.
- **Assess External Financing Options**: If needed, choose between debt and equity based on cost, control implications, and risk tolerance.
