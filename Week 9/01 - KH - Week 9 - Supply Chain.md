## 🔑 Six Key Components of Supply Chain Management

1. **Planning**
   - Assess whether to **produce internally** or **outsource** (domestically/internationally).
   - Align decisions with business strategy (e.g. cost, speed, sustainability).

2. **Sourcing**
   - Identify and assess **suppliers** for raw materials, components, or services.
   - Build reliable **supplier relationships** and manage risk.

3. **Demand Inventory**
   - Match **stock levels** and **production schedules** to demand forecasts.
   - Balance between **overstocking** (waste) and **understocking** (lost sales).

4. **Production**
   - Ensure the right **volume**, **quality**, and **timing** of product creation.
   - Streamline processes for efficiency and cost control.

5. **Warehouse & Transportation**
   - Decide how and where to **store** products and how to **deliver** them.
   - Key focus: speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of logistics.

6. **Return of Goods**
   - Manage **returns**, **exchanges**, and **after-sales service**.
   - Essential for **customer satisfaction** and **reverse logistics**.
