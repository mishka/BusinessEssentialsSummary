   - Formula: **Revenue - Expenses = Net Profit (or Loss)**.

   - Displays assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity.
   - Formula: **Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder Equity**.
   - Key components:
     - **Assets**: Cash, accounts receivable, inventory, land, buildings, etc.
     - **Liabilities**: Loans, accounts payable, mortgages.
     - **Equity**: Shareholder capital, retained earnings.

3. **Cash Flow Statement**:

   - Profit ≠ Cash flow due to timing differences in revenue & expense recognition.

     - **Cash Outflows**: Inventory, wages, rent, taxes.
