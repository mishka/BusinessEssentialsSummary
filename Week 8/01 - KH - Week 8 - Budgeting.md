# Week 8 – Budgeting

## 📌 What is a Budget?
- An **estimate** of expected **income and expenditure** over a future period.
- A **business budget** is a financial plan detailing **revenues** and **costs**.

---

## 🎯 Why Businesses Use Budgets
- To measure progress against **objectives and targets**.
- To **control costs** and assign responsibility via **budget holders**.
- To provide **direction** and clarity.
- To monitor **actual vs. budgeted performance**.

---

## ✅ What Makes an Effective Budget?
- Realistic **sales forecasts** (based on research).
- Conservative assumptions.
- Comprehensive and **itemised cost estimates**.
- Avoiding over-optimism.

---

## 💷 Categories of Costs
- **Labour** (wages, salaries).
- **Materials** (raw inputs).
- **Overheads** (utilities, rent, insurance).

---

## 📆 Types of Budgets
- **Periodic Budget**: Set for a fixed time (e.g. yearly), minimal changes.
- **Continual / Rolling Budget**: Continuously updated, adds a new month as one ends.

---

## ⚠️ Common Budgeting Issues
- Difficult to allocate fairly.
- Risk of **spending just to use budget** (“use it or lose it” mindset).
- Time-consuming for managers.

---

## 🔍 Budgetary Control & Variance Analysis
- Compare **actual** vs. **budgeted** figures.
- Investigate **variances**:
  - **Adverse variance**: Actual profit < budgeted.
  - **Favourable variance**: Actual profit > budgeted.

### Causes of Variances
- Economic shifts, wage increases, external shocks, currency fluctuations, competitor activity.

### Material Variance Examples
- **Favourable**: Bulk discounts, cheaper materials.
- **Adverse**: Price increases, higher-quality suppliers.

### Labour Variance Examples
- **Favourable**: Lower-skilled staff, reduced bonuses.
- **Adverse**: Skilled staff, wage increases, overtime.

---

## 🔄 The Budget Cycle
- Create → Implement → Monitor → Review → Adjust.

---

## 💰 Cash Budgets
- Track **cash inflows/outflows** (not profits).
- Used for:
  - Decision-making (e.g. borrowing/investing).
  - Planning for **liquidity**.
  - Controlling expenditure.
- Essential: Businesses can **be profitable but still run out of cash**.

---

## 🧾 Profit vs. Cash
- **Profit** = Revenue – Expenses.
- **Cash** = Actual money available.
- E.g. A customer buys £50,000 worth of goods on credit – no immediate cash.

---

## 💼 Cost Classifications
- **Variable Costs**: Vary with activity (materials, commissions).
- **Fixed Costs**: Stay constant (rent, salaries, insurance).

---

## 📊 Sales Budget
- Predicts revenue by estimating **sales volume × price**.
- Example: Product A sells 800 units at £5 = £4,000 revenue (Jan).

### 📊 Example:

| Product   | Qty   | Price  | Revenue   |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Boilers   | 250   | £1,500 | £375,000  |
| Repairs   | 500   | £400   | £200,000  |
| Maint.    | 1,000 | £100   | £100,000  |
| **Total** |       |        | £675,000  |

---

## 🧮 Expenditure Budget (Startup Focus)
- Lists all **expected spending** before and after launch.
- Common categories:
  - Premises, salaries, energy, equipment.
  - Marketing, travel, legal, professional services.
- Vital for ensuring **cash flow sustainability**.

---

## 💹 Profit Budget
- Combines sales and expenditure budgets to forecast **net profit/loss**.
- Highlights when business may face losses despite future profit potential.

---

## 🧠 Setting a Budget (Especially for Startups)
- Speak to **customers/suppliers** to build assumptions.
- Accept uncertainty – include **contingency buffers**.
- **Revise** budgets regularly based on performance and market shifts.

---

## ❗ Limitations of Budgets
- Based on **assumptions**, not guarantees.
- Start-ups lack historical data.
- Budgeting shouldn’t distract from building the business.
